## SkillMMO

SkillMMO is a Fabric mod that enables an RPG-/MMO-like skill system where
certain skills must be gained before the player can do certain things.

It's heavily inspired by the following mods/plugins:
- [Project MMO](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/project-mmo), a Forge mod
- [LevelZ](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/levelz), a Fabric mod
- [mcMMO](https://mcmmo.org/), a Bukkit/Spigot/Paper plugin

### Concepts

SkillMMO has a few core concepts that underpin the mod:
- Skills, which are broad categories of knowledge or proficiency
- Levels, which players gain by getting experience and use to advance in a skill of their choosing
    - Idea: Maybe some skills can be based on experience _practicing that skill_? e.g. to gain XP in Animal Husbandry you might need to tame animals?
- Unlocks, which allow players to start using a certain thing (block, item, entity, etc.) through reaching a certain level in a skill
- (Not yet implemented) Abilities, which are awarded to players for reaching a certain level in a certain skill
    - These are configured as Origins powers, so you'll need to install the Origins mod to gain and configure them!

All of the above are configured using datapacks. In fact, all the default skills and unlocks are configured through the datapack system!
